# Ai-abuse
This will be used for documenting ways i found to "abuse" ai. This could range from jailbreaks to bypasses or even abusing a service to get rewards / free stuff.

Promts will be in .txt files when i find them and labeled accordingly.

# Comet ai (browser)
Im working on finding a use for comet ai agentic mode, the only real use i have been able to find is for it to bulk apply for jobs. 

Im looking into using reward sites such as swagbucks / others for anything i can make it do for some money

# Openclaw (local ai)
100% has some interesting uses, however the fact that it has full access and local is a huge security risk. This ai could probably do what comet ai can, better and for free. Until more security can be put in place i will not be running this ai.
