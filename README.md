# Ai-abuse
This will be used for documenting ways i found to "abuse" ai. This could range from jailbreaks to bypasses or even abusing a service to get rewards / free stuff.

Promts will be in .txt files when i find them and labeled accordingly.

# Comet ai (browser)
Currently comet ai is task automation with ai. 
You are limited to a monthly amount of agentic interactions,i cant find how many you get per month. but i am looking for a bypass to reset that number so we can keep using the features for free

Currently working:
- Microsoft reward points auto task
- Have a working bypass for survey sites (private), optimising. trying to make it loop

# Openclaw (local ai)
100% has some interesting uses, however the fact that it has full access and local is a huge security risk. This ai could probably do what comet ai can, better and for free. Until more security can be put in place i will not be running this ai.
